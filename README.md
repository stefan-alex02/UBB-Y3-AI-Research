# A new perspective on using generative learning and multimodal data fusion for the classification of severe weather phenomena

## Abstract

Clouds play an essential role in Earth's climate, being the source of precipitation, controlling the amount of solar energy that reaches the surface of our planet, as well as affecting the overall Earth radiation budget. Thus, cloud classification is important as it helps in weather forecasting and supervising climate changes. Clouds are organized in many forms, their composition and density are variable, with different colours and heights, which makes their classification a challenging one. This paper proposes several Machine earning (ML) models and hybrid pipelines, including a Diffusion-based and a Vision Transformer-based classifier, for classifying various cloud images, and analyses their performance and ability of learning to extract and classify the features of distinct cloud types. Experiments are conducted on two ground-based cloud data sets of different sizes and characteristics, using data augmentation and by training each of the implemented approaches. The performances of the best proposed versions are then compared to that of other deep learning architectures used in the literature for clouds classification. The comparative analysis highlights metric scores around the same range, in terms of Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1-score.
